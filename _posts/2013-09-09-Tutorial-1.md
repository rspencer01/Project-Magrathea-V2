title: Tutorial 1 - Hello Big World!
---

Welcome to the first in a series of tutorials about how to roll your own world.  This series will be part theory, part practice with it getting more theoretical as time goes on.  There _will_ be code to start with, don't worry, but as time goes on.

These pages are pitched to people with little to no OpenGL programming experience at all, and will go from the basics, showing one style.  There are others, and for a full view of OpenGL programming, one should consult other tutorials as well.

Enough meta stuff, lets get cracking.

This tutorial is all about getting a helloworld screen like this:

Firstly, some terminology.  According to Wikipedia, _"**OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)** is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D computer graphics."_  In other words, its a set of functions for doing visual stuff.

**GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)**, or freeGLUT, is the library that handles interaction with the operating system, managing windows, mouse io and keyboards.

**GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)** is a library that helps load OpenGL extensions.

So to start we will need freeglut and glew.  These are downloadable here and here, from which you should follow the instructions on the web.  In a linux box one can run

    $sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libglew1.6-dev

Right.  Now lets get coding.  Firstly lets take a look at the directory structure I suggest.

    magrathea
    +-- src
    |   +-- include
    |   |   +-- magrathea.h
    |   |   +-- game.h
    |   |   `-- ...
    |   +-- Makefile
    |   +-- main.cpp
    |   +-- game.cpp
    |   `-- ...
    +-- .gitignore 
    `-- README.md
        
If you are unfamiliar with makefiles, I suggest you go and look them up.  They are very useful.  Ours is simple.

    # The g++ compiler.
    CC = g++
    # Flags passed to the compiler
    CFLAGS = -c -Wall -Werror
    IDIR = include
    ODIR = obj
    SRCS = main.cpp gameops.cpp vector3.cpp graphics.cpp heightmap.cpp
    _OBJS = $(SRCS:.cpp=.o)
    OBJS = $(patsubst %,$(ODIR)/%,$(_OBJS))
    EXEC = magrathea
    LIBS = -lglut -lGLU 

    all: $(ODIR) $(OBJS) $(EXEC)

    $(ODIR):
        mkdir $(ODIR)

    $(EXEC): $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(OBJS) $(LIBS) -o $(EXEC)

    $(ODIR)/%.o: %.cpp $(DEPS)
        $(CC) -I $(IDIR) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $<

    clean:
        rm -r $(ODIR)
        rm $(EXEC)

Also note the .gitignore.  Once again, if you are unfamiliar with git, I suggest you go and read up a bit about it.  It is not a requirement, but it does make things nice.  

Now, lets define a class `Game` in `include/game.h`.  It will have a constructor and a function called `run` that takes no arguments.  Our `main.cpp` will hold the entry to the program, `main` (doh), and will look as follows

    {% highlight cpp %}
    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        Game mainGame;
        mainGame.run();
        return 0;
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

In `game.cpp`, we will create the game as follows

    {% highlight cpp %}
    Game::Game()
    {
      int argc = 0;
      char arg[10] =  "magrathea";
      char** argv = (char**)&arg;
      glutInit(&argc,argv);
      glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE|GLUT_RGBA);
      // A begginning window size and position.  This will eventualy be full screen
      glutInitWindowSize(500,500);
      glutInitWindowPosition(100,100);
      glutCreateWindow("Magrathea");
      // What functions should glut call?
      glutDisplayFunc(displayCurrentGame);
      currentGame = this;
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

But what is this `currentGame` and `displayCurrentGame`?  Well, when GLUT wants to display something, it calls whatever argument you pass to `glutDisplayFunc`.  However this needs to be a static function, so we define, in `game.cpp`, above `Game::Game`

    {% highlight cpp %}
    Game* currentGame;
    void displayCurrentGame()
    {
      currentGame->display();
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

All great, right?  Not quite.  We don't know what `display()` does.  That is easy.  Declare display as a public function of Game, and define

    {% highlight cpp %}
    void Game::display()
    {
      glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
      glClearColor(1,0,0,0.5);
      glutSwapBuffers();
    }
    {% endhighlight %}

The first line resets the buffer (more on this in later tutorials), the second makes the screen red, and the third actually puts it to the screen.

Finally the run function is really simple.  Glut has a main loop (from which it calls the `display` function), and to enter it, we simply do

    {% highlight cpp %}
    void Game::run()
    {
      glutMainLoop();
    }
    {% endhighlight %}
