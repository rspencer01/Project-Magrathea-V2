Hopefully over the next few weeks, this blog will contain updates on the progress of Project Magrathea (complete with pictures!).  I will also be uploading a tutorial, the likes of which I would like to have existed when I started.

But for starters lets just see where this project is now.  So far there is a smallish (1 km square or so) world that the player can walk around in.  This world has some trees, leaf-like plants and shadows (that move!).  There is also a weird bird type thing.

The terrain that you walk around over is not completely made up.  The heightmap data for the ground is taken from [here](http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html).  It is a small section of North-America.  This will, eventually be replaced with completely fictional terrain.

What are the final goals of the project?  A realistic world.  Nothing major!  Well, I can list some things that will not be in the game.  There will be no gameplay.  The "player" can just walk around and enjoy the scenery.  Apart from that, everything goes, really.  Land, plants, rocks, animals, clouds etc.  Everything that makes the environment more realistic goes.  Look will be placed far before frame rate.  I expect that by the time this project gets anywhere close to "completion" the computers of the time will be much better than they are right now.

Thats all for today folks!  As a parting shot, though, here is a picture of progress so far.
