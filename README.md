Project-Magrathea-V2
====================

The second generation realistic terrain project.
The first version ended up dying as a result of too many changes of mind.  This will hopefully be better.

Goals:
 * Import a heightmap and display it.
 * Do this by caching data near the player (don't load it all at once)
 * Determine the type of terrain at each point algorithmically
 * Display this with textures
 * Introduce basic vegetation (this may need to be a second project, at first)
 * See from there.
