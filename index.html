<h3><a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Project Magrathea (the second)</h3>

<p> Project Magrathea (v1) was started in about May 2013 as an attempt to get to OpenGL and, in part, to replicate the results of <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=11874"> Project Frontier </a>.  However, where the author of that project stated in post 4 that he was "... not aiming for realism. [He is] looking for whimsical, retro, and fantastic.", Project Magrathea
was to be as realistic as possible.  Things went fairly well (considering the author had never touched graphics programming before) but then disaster struck when terrain rendering was too slow and unrealistic.</p>

<p> Nothing much happened then for a while, until the project got a complete reboot, from the beginning, giving you this version.

<p> At the moment, it has a long way to go, but it is getting there steadily.  We will hopefully have some screenshots up here soon. </p>

<p>If you would like to browse, checkout or even edit the code, simply run </p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/rspencer01/Project-Magrathea-V2
</code></pre>

<p> There is a lot more documentation in the repo, but that also, will move to this site as well. </p>
